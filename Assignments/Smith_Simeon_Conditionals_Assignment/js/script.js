c.  At least 1 ternary conditional statement must be used
d.  At least 1 Logical Operator && , || or !
e.  Must contain at least 3 user prompts that are used in calculations
f.  All prompts must be validated

Instructions

 d. Continuously commit your files to your GitHub repo throughout the development
    process.  You should have a minimum of 5 meaningful commits for this assignment.
 e. Your code should give the user meaningful output.  So, after your calculations are
    complete, your code should report back to the user the final values with a console.log().
    This should contain the variables that you calculated and a concatenation text string
    that describes the value. e.g.  console.log(“The area of the rectangle is “ +calcArea+ ”!”);
 f. After your code is complete, make sure you test your final files.  Try typing in
    different values to see what you get.  Put these test values in a multi-lined comment
    at the bottom of your js file. e.g. /*  I typed in 5 for length and 6 for height and my
    calculator gave me 30 for the area.*/
